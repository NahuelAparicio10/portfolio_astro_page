###  **About**
<div className="text-justify">
This **FPS prototype** blends the thrill of first-person combat with a unique survival concept set in a **mining environment.** Players must explore **monster-filled mines, gather resources,** and **craft stronger ammunition** while battling increasingly tougher enemies as they descend deeper into the mine.

The project allowed us to dive into the complexities of **first-person gameplay** and gain experience with mechanics such as shooting, player movement, and level design.

<div className="text-justify">
I developed the **enemy systems**, including **enemy AI behaviors (FSM)**, and created the **menu system.** **I customized and optimized the FPS plug-in** to better suit the game's mechanics, integrating it into the project. Additionally, I **designed the game concept** and was responsible for all aspects of level design, ensuring engaging exploration and progression. 

These contributions helped ensure the completion of a functional and immersive prototype.
