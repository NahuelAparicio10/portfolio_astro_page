###  **Project Info**

üë§ Role: Solo Programmer
üë• Team Size: 7  
‚è≥ Time frame: 24 weeks (6 months)  
üéÆ Engine: Unity  
```

###  **About**
<div className="text-justify">

In El Sopla Juego, a **3D FPS**, the player steps into the shoes of a garbage collector armed with a unique weapon ‚Äî a **vacuum cleaner** that can suck, blow, and shoot absorbed objects. After breaking a neighbor‚Äôs garden gnome, the protagonist is forced to repay the debt by completing a variety of missions across the city.

This project was developed as a final degree project in collaboration with a team of artists and musicians. I joined as the **sole programmer**, responsible for turning the team‚Äôs creative vision into a functional game. My work focused on designing and implementing all gameplay systems while integrating artistic and audio assets into Unity, ensuring a cohesive and playable prototype.

<div className="text-justify">

As the only programmer on the team, I took full responsibility for the game‚Äôs technical development. I implemented the vacuum-based player mechanics (suction, blowing, and projectile shooting), created the object physics interactions, and developed systems for quests, dialogues, and saving/loading. Additionally, I designed and programmed the UI and UX, ensuring intuitive player feedback, and integrated all visual and audio assets provided by the artists and musicians.
