###  **About**
<div className="text-justify">
This **survival game** was developed using Eden, another title created by our team, as its foundation. Our goal was to create an **intense experience** centered around the **dash mechanic** as core damage dealer.

During development, our team focused on **clean, reusable code and the challenges of scaling**, which reinforced both technical skills and collaborative workflows.

I **designed and programmed multiple dash mechanics**, implemented the **quest system and JSON-based save/load data**, along with the corresponding UI elements. Additionally, I conducted **QA testing** to identify bugs and balance gameplay statistics, ensuring a polished and enjoyable experience.
