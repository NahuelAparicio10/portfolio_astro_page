###  **Project Info**  

```markdown
üë§ Role: Solo Project
üë• Team Size: 1  
‚è≥ Time frame: 8 weeks (2 months)

###  **About**

<div className="text-justify">
This dynamic **platformer game** features three exciting levels: a comprehensive tutorial and two fast-paced stages where you will battle various enemies and parkours to complete your quest.

This was a **solo project** that allowed me to deepen my understanding of game development and Unity while **focusing on maintaining clean code throughout the process.**
