###  **About**
<div className="text-justify">
This **2D Roguelike** challenges players to progress as far as possible by completing rooms and upgrading their abilities through a variety of items. The core mechanic revolves around dashing. Mastering the dash system is key to achieving success. 

Our goal with this project was to create **engaging gameplay** centered around the **dash mechanic** and a challenging **build system.** We also aimed to design a balanced progression path that includes **quests**, **permanent upgrades**, and **collectible items**.
